## Installation

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running Models

There are multiple ways to run the models:

1.  **Using individual main scripts:**

    Each model has its own main script in the `main/` directory. You can run them directly, specifying the mode (train/test) and other options. Configuration for these scripts is managed through corresponding YAML files in the `config/` directory.

    ```bash
    # Example: Train a new MLP model
    python main/main_mlp.py --mode train

    # Example: Test with a pretrained CNN model
    python main/main_cnn.py --mode test --pretrained

    # Example: Train an autoregressive LSTM
    python main/main_auto_regressive_lstm.py --mode train
    ```
    Refer to the specific `main_<model_type>.py` script and its associated `config/<model_type>.yml` file for more details on configurable parameters.

2.  **Using the shell scripts:**

    - **[`run.sh`](run.sh)**: Runs both training and testing sequentially
    ```bash
    # Usage: ./run.sh <model_name> [pretrained]
    
    # Example: Run the rnn model (assumes rnn.yml config exists)
    ./run.sh rnn
    
    # Example: Run with pretrained weights
    ./run.sh rnn pretrained
    ```
    
    - **[`train.sh`](train.sh)**: Runs training only
    ```bash
    # Usage: ./train.sh <model_name> [pretrained]
    
    # Example: Train a specific model
    ./train.sh lstm
    
    # Example: Train using pretrained weights
    ./train.sh lstm pretrained
    ```
    
    - **[`test.sh`](test.sh)**: Runs testing/inference only
    ```bash
    # Usage: ./test.sh <model_name>
    
    # Example: Test a trained model
    ./test.sh cnn
    ```
    
    **Arguments:**
    - `<model_name>` (required): The model type to run (e.g., `rnn`, `lstm`, `cnn`, `mlp`)
    - `pretrained` (optional): Use pretrained weights for training (only available for `run.sh` and `train.sh`)
    
    Ensure the scripts have execute permissions (`chmod +x *.sh`). The scripts expect the model name as an argument, which corresponds to the main script file and its configuration file.

## Logging and Backups
- Training progress, including loss curves and configuration files, is logged in the `logs/` directory.
